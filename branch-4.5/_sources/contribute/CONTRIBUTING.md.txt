## Contributing code to Scylla

Before you can contribute code to Scylla for the first time, you should sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://www.scylladb.com/open-source/contributor-agreement/) and send the signed form cla@scylladb.com. You can then submit your changes as patches to the to the [scylladb-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/scylladb-dev) or as a pull request to the [Scylla project on github](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla).
If you need help formatting or sending patches, [check out these instructions](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla/wiki/Formatting-and-sending-patches).

The Scylla C++ source code uses the [Seastar coding style](https://github.com/scylladb/seastar/blob/master/coding-style.md) so please adhere to that in your patches. Note that Scylla code is written with `using namespace seastar`, so should not explicitly add the `seastar::` prefix to Seastar symbols. You will usually not need to add `using namespace seastar` to new source files, because most Scylla header files have `#include "seastarx.hh"`, which does this.
